<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>We provide education and hands on training to students and any interested parties in fiber optic theory and optical components that are commonly used in telecommunication industry such as Fiber to the Premises.
FTTP (fiber-to-the-premises): where the fiber network includes both homes, businesses and cell towers. FTTP consists of the following:
• FTTH (fiber-to-the-home): Fiber reaches the boundary of the living space, such as a box on the outside wall of a home. 
• FTTB (fiber-to-the-building, -business, or -basement): Fiber reaches the boundary of the building, such as the basement in a multi-dwelling unit, with the final connection to the individual living space being made via optical fiber.
• FTTD (fiber-to-the-desktop): Fiber connection is installed from the main computer room to a terminal or fiber media converter near the user's desk.
• FTTA (fiber-to-the-antenna): Broadband network architecture in which optical fiber is used to connect the remote radio head (RRH) to the base station in new antennas, or retrofitted in existing ones, to replace all or part of the coax local loop.
We also provide training and US technical fiber optics certification (T-FOC™) for technicians that are looking to work in fiber optic and telecommunication industry.
T-FOC™ - Technician with Fiber Optic Certification - is the US standard certification for general fiber optics applications. T-FOC have appropriate knowledge, skills and abilities in fiber optics that can be applied to almost any job - design, installation, operation - for almost any application - outside plant, premises, manufacturing, etc. This US based certification is founded on an extensive knowledge of fiber optics technology and application as well as demonstrated skills in appropriate tasks. Most T-FOC will work in the industry as contractors or installers. Consultants, network designers, estimators and trainers would also be expected to have such credentials. Many T-FOC are involved with the manufacture of fiber optic components such as cables, patchcords, active devices and communications systems.
We also carry a line of state of the art optical equipment such as Termination Station, Optical Polishers, Interferometers, Network Analyzers, Optical Time Domain Reflectometers, Power Meters, Optical Microscopes.
We can host business seminars, technical events and optical trade shows.
We can teach a fiber optic course in English and Spanish with a level of US MSEE equivalent at a mutually agreed cost.
